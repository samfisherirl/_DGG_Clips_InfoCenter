<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get started with DGG Clips Resources, you'll need to have a basic understanding of how clipping tools work and some familiarity with Destiny's streaming platforms. From there, we guide you through everything you need to create and share engaging clips.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* Any device capable of streaming and capturing video content
* Basic video editing software for enhancing clips
* An account on platforms where Destiny streams (e.g., Twitch or YouTube)

### Installation

1. Choose your preferred clipping tool. We recommend starting with native tools provided by the streaming platform (e.g., Twitch Clips).
